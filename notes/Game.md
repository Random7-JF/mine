## Premise
You have to guide a mine cart of gear from one point to another point in the map. The rails are damaged and patrolled by enemies, Enemies will do damage to your loot if they get to it and you'll lose points. Enemies might break your rails and you'll need to repair.

There will be materials to make the rails around the map and you need to make and connect the rails so it gets to the end. There will also be more gear you can add to your mine cart for more points and possible weapon upgrades / power ups  / etc..

Possible Proc-gen can be used to make levels, or a mix of level design and proc gen. If Proc-gen can be used it can be made into a gauntlet and go until you die type deal.
