A level will have an objective
Objective examples:
- Take cart from point A to B
	- Escort
	- Enemies spawn as you go
	- Need to find materials to repair sections of rails.
	- Find and add resources for a bonus
- Multiple carts from point A to B
	- Gantlet
	- Multiple mine carts spawn, you need to take them all to the same point.
	- Limited resources means you might have to pull old tracks for another cart
	- Limited repair as well
	- Get as many carts to the end.
	- Enemies spawn as you go

## Level Complications
- Bridge needed
	- you need to get other resources to repair a bridge
	- you might need to go get another card to bring resources to the bridge to build or fix it.

## Mine carts
- More resources you collect the more minecarts are part of your train.
- if one breaks, the resources drop and you can't load them back up
